# CluedoAssignment1

A simple Text based version of the classic board game, Cluedo.

We used a uml class diagram to generate the majority of the base code.

Along with class diagrams, we included CRC cards that were used to describe the rolls of each class
and who they will communicate/collaborate with.

Student/collaborators:
  - Victoria Roberts ( robertvict )
  - Daniel Neville ( nevilldani ) 
  - Ketaki Bagal ( bagalketa )
